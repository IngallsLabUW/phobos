\usage{
AnnotateConfidenceLevel1(
  experimental.values,
  theoretical.values,
  mz.flexibility,
  rt.flexibility
)
}
\arguments{
\item{experimental.values}{A dataframe of unknown experimental values, created by the user.
It is important to note that it must be in the following format, including capitalization and class:
MassFeature (character), mz (numeric), rt (numeric, in seconds), column (numeric), z (numeric), MS2 (in concatenated format, character).
For more information on concatenated format, please refer to the README documentation.}

\item{theoretical.values}{A dataframe of known, theoretical values; in the case of this package, the Ingalls Standards list.
Like its partner the experimental.values dataframe, the theoretical.values dataframe columns needs to be in
the following exact format: compound (character), mz (numeric), rt (numeric, in seconds),
column (all caps, character), z (numeric), OPTIONAL filename (character), and MS2 (concatenated format, character). This package includes
a csv of theoretical values for example purposes, but for the latest version please head to the Ingalls Standards github: https://github.com/IngallsLabUW/Ingalls_Standards}

\item{mz.flexibility}{Flexibility for m/z matching between experimental and theoretical values. Usually defined as 0.02.}

\item{rt.flexibility}{Flexibility for retention time matching between experimental and theoretical values. Usually defined as ~ 15-30 seconds.}
}
\value{
A dataframe annotated for Confidence Level 1, including mz/rt/total similarity scores, as well as confidence rank and confidence source.
}
\description{
Compare a dataframe of experimental values with a dataframe of all theoretical values from the Ingalls
Lab Standards sheet.

\examples{
library(phobos)
# Isolate experimental data. Remember that phobos REQUIRES all experimental dataframes to be in the following format:
# - "MassFeature": Your unique mass feature, character.
# - "mz": The mz value, numeric.
# - "rt": The retention time, in seconds, numeric.
# - "column": Column the mass feature was run on, character.
#      There are two options for this variable: "HILIC" or "RP" (short for Reverse Phase).
#      In the Ingalls lab, cyano compounds are only ever run in positive mode, therefore the combination of an "RP"
#      column observation and a "1" z observation will results in the correct analysis.
# - "z": The polarity, numeric.
# - "MS2": MS2 data for those compounds that have it, character, in concatenated format.

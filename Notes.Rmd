*Comments from latest Wkumler review*
CL1
- I was thinking I'd prioritize good feedback ("columns are correct", "classes are correct", etc.) so it's clear that the functions are running. Some of them take more time than others.
- The rowwise is slow, but the entire run time of the function is still only <10 seconds. I could try an sapply solution to see if that speeds things up. What do you mean by NA handling inside the function?
- Make a better stop() function for compound check
- Be specific about the cutoffs, hard coded is nono or explain

CL2
- Maybe I could include shrunken versions of the scraped Massbank stuff, similar to the example data. I don't want to change 
the overall format due to lost metadata but I can shrink things. And yeah. MBP is huge and slow. I wonder if it's because there is more data in each entry, are things better detected in positive mode? I think i've seen arguments for both sides.
- Let's discuss adduct formation. The code that I have there (MH_mass +/-) is from KRH's original code and probably could use an update.
- When things weren't parallelized, it was taking a lot longer (maybe 5 mins?). I adjusted the code to run a check for OS and then parallel/nonparallel depending on output.

CL3
- Same code to prepare the Mona sheets, left as was for a) trying to have the steps be potentially independent and b) to retain access to the Mona metadata.
- Make a better stop() function for compound check
- Be specific about the cutoffs, hard coded is nono or explain

utils
- no hard coding if possible
*Notes*

- Styler package. style_pkg(), style_dir(), etc. Keep it tidy. Commit before application of style changes. See Ch 7.3 for deets.

- Final full documentation check.
- Need to combine MS2 from standards list.
- Add MoNA scrape code to package.
- Figure out how to properly create KEGG homesheet.
- Documentation for interpreting output. Column description and clarity.
- CL2 class level check, maybe for the rest of the CLs as well.
- Check collision energy stuff.
- Check the MH mass and exact mass stuff in MoNA level 3: necesssary?
- Check all TODO tags in the README.
- Make Metlin hard to reach. Don't overload. Scrape what we don't know, like KRH's unknowns.
- KEGG and future dataframes: should those be 3.5, or a different kind of ranking? Sorting is a bit of a problem.
- How to best update the "Theoretical Data" for CL1? Similar to the quarterly update/up-to-user update? 
- Is each step independent of the rest?
- Column class for every dataframe. Midsection checks.
- Documentation for CL4.
- 1.5 confidence
- Interpret output documentation

### Other comments

- Fragment matching: % of library sample found in fragments. 
    Example, experimental spectra has *110.97466, 100;* 110.03485, 39.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 68.01299, 26.6; 111.01888, 20.6.
    Library spectra has               *110.97466, 100;* 109.00000, 40.1; *58.02862, 33.5;* 70.33989, 26.6; 121.04950, 15.0.
    If the above two lines were identical, the fragment match would be 100%. In this situation, the fragment match would be 40% or 0.4.
- The "replacing" of the theoretical values to cut down on columns should be a hidden function.
- For retention time, use the standard runs that are in the same batches to calibrate retention time. This would be BEFORE entering MARS. MARS will not facilitate this step most likely. 

- For DDA high resolution, the mass spec sees a high signal. When it see that, it takes above and below that signal and isolates it in the collision chamber. In the ms2 df, the first column is the exact mass with an intensity of 100 (maximum), then second mass and intensity, etc.

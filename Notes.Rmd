This is a build notes page. It is included on the .Rbuildignore and is therefore hidden from the build process. It will be deleted when the package is complete.

*Notes*

- Remember the available() app
- Sys.time should be defined WITHIN the function, not as a package variable. See Chapter 6 for details.
  Timestamp function (ch 6) should be kept local.
- Styler package. style_pkg(), style_dir(), etc. Keep it tidy. Commit before application of style changes. See Ch 7.3 for deets.
